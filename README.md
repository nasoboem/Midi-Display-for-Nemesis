# Midi Display for the Source Audio Nemesis Delay

I had a programmable midi controler puting on dust. I have three GRIDs (EN16, Bu16 and EF44 first generation) from Intech Studios.
I met them at Super Booth 2025 in Berlin and had a look at theire new lineup (generation 3) which now has modules with a display. Mine however does not have a display and niether has the Nemesis from Source Audio.
Therefore when I would program the midi controler I wouldn't know what I was doing on the nemesis pedal. So I had the idear to build a display, a midi listener that would show me
what kind of midi data I would send to my guitar pedal.
I hope that anybody can follow along and build their midi setup to unlock your guitar pedal true potential.
The Source Audio Nemesis is a very good candidate to get such an upgrade, because one can hardly access 1/3 of its features from the front panel. The rest is only accessable via the Neuron App or via midi. The midi
capablilities of the Nemesis are virtualy compleat and the documentation exelent. A very good starting point for the project.
